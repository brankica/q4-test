# q4-test

I have addressed all issues except:

1. Set up the local node.js server to require release.json. I wasn't sure how to then import the data into a client.js. I ran into an issue on my development mashine with package.json not being up-to-date and didn't have enought time to continue.

2. I couldn't figure out exactly why the time is different after date-time formatting. I didn't find the documentation clear.
